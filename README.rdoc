Postcode Jobs allows people to search for jobs and employee's based on there postcode. I used Single Table Inheritance (STI) to register Employers and Jobseekers in one table Users. I used dynamic binding to save users in the Users controller. I also used the Geocoder gem to identify longitude and latitude from a postcode.
